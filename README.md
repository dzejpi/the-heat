![2023-01-08_11-49-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18399695/211214820-ec76bce7-af19-4451-9414-4c09511e03a6.png)

Great rumors are spreading far and wide. It seems that the earth is becoming parched and dry. Some speak of the sun's heat intensifying to the point where it is setting all ablaze. There are hushed whispers of Tzitzimitl's return spreading throughout the land. Could our final days be nigh?

## How to play
You can switch between items either by using middle mouse button or by pressing `1`, `2`, `3` or `4` on your keyboard.

* 1: Nothing
* 2: Sickle. You need to equip sickle in order to be able to harvest crops. Once equipped, go to the nearest crop field and click on it. If you do, you will harvest it. You need to bring your harvest into the harvest bin next to your house. Once carrying crop, you cannot switch between items. Hurry up! Also remember that cannot harvest burning crop.
* 3: Bucket. You can use bucket to put out the fire. Do not forget to fill it with water first. Equip the bucket, look at the water well and fill the bucket by left click.
* 4: Spade. You can use spade to destroy any crop. If the crop is on fire, destroying it with spade will put the fire out as well. Use to your advantage!

Try to save as many crops as you can. The end is near.

## My commentary
This was my first 3D LD game! I was playing around with 3D for quite some time, but this LD was time to put my knowledge to test. All of my lucky stars had to be aligned properly, because I actually haven't run into any major issues. I learned so many things; more than last few months combined. This was the most fun LD I have had so far.

And since last December, I have a Windows desktop, which means that I am no longer stuck on rating HTML5, so there is not going to be any big delay rating your Windows games as well!
